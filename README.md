* Known issues / further plans estimated for 5-8 more hours
- full unit-testing
- product category assignment
- moving to admin namespace and styling of form to fit admin-panel
- working options "override duplicates" and "notify on finish"
- delayed job monitoring

p.s. I really think this is a bit more than few hours task ;-) But anyway I've enjoyed doing research and implementing functionality
